# Geometry-Calculator-JS
Duration: May 2020 - July 2020

This is my summer 2020 project where I made a geometry calculator web page. This was a revival of my previous geometric calculator made in python. I decided to remake this project because I was especially excited this concept and I thought it was more appropriate to make this app as a website. This was my largest project that spanned 3 months. I learned a lot about making web pages with basic HTML, CSS, and JS and how to work on large scale projects involing thousands of lines of code. I learned to write clean and scalable code and to document my work both in script and with a txt file. I also wrote a weekly dev log to keep track of my progress and to reflect on the state of the project so far.
In this project, I made a canvas app that allows the users to create geometric figures and analyze its properties like length, area, and angle. It is very precise and allows the user to build very complex shapes.

Some of its features include:
	Construction of Points, lines, line segment, circles, polygon and exact figures;
	Measure of Length, Angle, Area and Perimeter;
	Geometric transformations;
	Special lines including medians, perpendicular line, tangents etc.;
	Selection of specific geometric objects;
	Auto line, polygon formation;


This project also gave me a lot of insight into using libaries like bootstrap, jquery and nodejs. It does not have the most eye pleasing UI but I believe it makes up for it in its technical features. While I believe this project is incomplete, I consider it at an MVP stage. Ultimately I decided to end the project at this current state because in part to both the pandemic fatigue and the overwhelming bugs that have arose from poorly planned out code. While I tried my best to write clean and abstract code, unforeseen features and complications led to rewriting a lot of core code. This taught me an important lesson on planning out features, organizing code and thinking carefully about data structures. I would like to come back to this project with more experience in web development and general software engineering skills to make this a more complete project.

Some things I would like to add/change:
	shifting of objects;
	better UI;
	bug fixes;
	Saving;
	Deleting;
	Undo;

The app is able to determine angle, area, perimeter and other geometric measures. (it is unlabeled, perhaps a feature for next time)
